Trying to replicate this example: http://chessboardjs.com/examples#1000

Looking for help to make this work.

```
# clone repo
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
$ yarn run webpack
```

Hopefully at that point you will have a file `/build/Index.js`.

Then, open /build/index.html in browser.  Doesn't current work.  Any
help appreciated!
